# Tavanyar (algorithm)

Tavanyar is a system which detects and evaluates physical therapy exercises automatically using motion tracking devices.
This project holds the core algorithm of the system. It uses multi-template multi-match dynamic time warping algorithm, 
which is a natural extension of subsequence dynamic time warping algorithm. Finally, we introduce 5 parameters so that 
optimizing them, optimizes the overall functionality of the system in terms of accuracy, performance, and memory usage.

## Parameters

- Distance function
- Local weights
- Length tolerance factor
- Overlapping factor
- Cost threshold
